## Purpose
The purpose of this web application is to increase the Refcon Groups' online presence and to give their clients an online platform to review the products and services that are offered. The Refcon Group is a family owned business that provides their clients with affordable air-conditioning and refrigeration units. They supply, install and repair these units.

At this point in time the Refcon Group has a very basic outdated website that was created using PHP. Our goal is to replace the current site with a more modern website built with the MERN stack that is responsive and better suits the purposes of our clients business.

## Functionality / Features
The new Refcon site will consist of the following features:
#### Photo Gallery
A photo gallery will provide a way for us to keep the website minimal while also providing the user with different information.
#### Services Pages
These pages are going to allow the Refcon Groups clientele to view and request quotes on particular services. They will also act as a UI for the admin account to create, update and delete the services listed on the website.   
#### User Reviews
Users Reviews will provide a way for the Refcon Group to receive feedback from their customers as well as testimonies on their quality of work and products.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this application are the owners of commercial and residential air-conditioning and refrigeration units or put simpily the already existing clientele of the Refcon Group.
